In the first of its kind at the Isha Yoga Center, in November, an Inner Engineering Retreat program was conducted exclusively for a group of Russian participants. Inner Engineering is a unique program that provides tools and solutions to empower you to create life the way you want it. It imparts practical wisdom to manage the body, mind, emotions, and the fundamental life energy within.

The program spanned over four days and was held right after the Russian participants returned from the Southern Sojourn, a 5-day yatra of some of the most magnificent temples of Southern India. The Center had never before hosted such a large group of people from Russia, but with three Russian-speaking volunteers providing translation support, the Inner Engineering program happened smoothly.

The Russians were enthusiastic and willing to absorb all that is offered by the consecrated space of the Isha Yoga Center. Some of the participants found the surroundings conducive to creating an atmosphere of inner peace, awareness, joy, and goodness. EDITED 1:30PM
